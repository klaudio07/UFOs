## Overview of the analysis.


-  Create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. 

-  Table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language. Apply your HTML and Bootstrap skills 
   

### Results:

1- *Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, written a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.*

-   Poupulated with main information such as City, State, Country, Shape, Duration and Comment.


2- *Created a basic HTML web page*

-   So that I can showcase the information and make it useful for other users.


3- *Used a date form in HTML document and written JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.*

-   Filters enable to search information 



# Summary:

-   One drawback of this webpage is that there is a lot of manual work. In addition the filters may not work properly on upper case.  Two additional recommendations for further development are as below:

1- Can proivde interesting visual information like graphs and maps for the density of UFOs appearing.

2- Can make filter navigation easier.
